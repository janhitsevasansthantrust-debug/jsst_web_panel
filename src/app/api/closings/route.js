 * reverting a closing appeared to do nothing: the revert succeeded, the query
 * was invalidated, the refetch went out — and the browser answered it from its
 * own cache with the pre-revert list. The closing sat there marked चालू for up
 * to sixty seconds, so the only sensible conclusion was that the revert had
 * failed. The same applied to a newly created closing.

 * The cache was buying nothing anyway: the index is already memoised on the
